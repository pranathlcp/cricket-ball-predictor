This repository contains the implementation of a Cricket T20 ball-by-ball outcome prediction model in R, using machine learning techniques and data manipulation in dplyr.

## Features
- Machine Learning Models:
  - Random Forest (weighted and non-weighted)
  - Logistic Regression with LASSO (weighted and non-weighted)
- Data Cleansing:
  - Extensive use of dplyr for cleaning and preprocessing large cricket datasets.
